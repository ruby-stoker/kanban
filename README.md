It's kanban which was developed with angular 5.2. As you can see, in HTML I used native drag features.
So in this component I get all candidates and all type statuses. The candidates are sorted in kanban by their status, and you can
change it moving a candidate into another column. Also, I wrote a small test using a standard test from Angular - Karna js.
